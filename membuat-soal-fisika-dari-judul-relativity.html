                                            Albert EinsteinAlbert Einstein was one of the most famous scientists of all time. He developed the special and general theories of relativity and made many other important discoveries.Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany. He grew up in a secular Jewish family. His father was a salesman and engineer and his mother was a housewife. Einstein had one sister, Maja, who was born two years after him. He studied at the Luitpold Gymnasium in Munich. He didnt like studying there. One teacher even told him that he would never get anywhere. At this time, Einstein became interested in classical music and he learned to play the violin. He was also interested in science.In the 1890s, Einsteins family moved to Milan, Italy. Einstein started studying at the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zürich. His years in Zürich were some of the happiest years of his life. He became friends with many other students and met his future wife, Mileva Maric, a physics student from Serbia.Einstein finished his university studies and found work in a Swiss patent office. In his free time, Einstein continued studying physics. He married Mileva Maric in 1903, but the marriage was not a happy one. They divorced in 1919 and Einstein married Elsa Löwenthal. In 1905, Einstein published four important papers about physics. The fourth paper included the famous equation E=mc2. In 1921, he won the Nobel Prize for Physics. From 1913 to 1933, Albert Einstein was the director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin. He often travelled around the world and gave talks about physics. While Einstein was travelling and speaking internationally, the Nazis were becoming more and more powerful. Einsteins life was in danger. In 1932, he decided to leave Germany forever. He moved to the United States and took on a position at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, New Jersey.Einstein became an American citizen in 1935. In 1939, he and his friend Leo Szilard wrote a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. They warned him that the Nazis might be trying to create an atomic bomb. The United States started a programme to create its own nuclear weapons. After learning of the 1945 bombing of Hiroshima, Einstein became active in trying to stop future use of nuclear weapons. He also supported the civil rights of African Americans. In 1952, he was offered to become the president of Israel, but he respectfully declined.Albert Einstein died on April 18, 1955, in Princeton, New Jersey.1 Read the text and answer the following questions.1 What was Albert Einsteins fathers job? _____________________________________________________________2 What did Albert Einstein do after he finished his university studies? _______________________________________3 When did Albert Einstein get the Nobel Prize for Physics? _______________________________________________4 Why did Einstein decide to leave Germany? __________________________________________________________5 When did Einstein become an American citizen? ______________________________________________________6 Why did Einstein write a letter to F.

                                            I.Read the following text carefully. 
In some ways pure mathematics became more abstract in the 20th century, as it joined forces with the field of symbolic logic in philosophy. The scholars who bridged the fields of mathematics and philosophy early in the century were Alfred North Whitehead and Betrand Russell, who worked together at Cambridge University. They published their major work, Principia Mathematica in three volumes from 1910 to 1913. In it they demonstrated the principle of methematical logic and attempted to show that all of mathematics could be deduced from a few premises and definitions by the rules of formal logic. In the late 19th century, German mathematician Gottlob Frege had provided the system of notation for mathematical logic and paved the way for the work of Russel and Whitehead. Mathematical logic influenced the direction of 20th century mathematics, including the work of Hilbert proposing that the underlying consistency of all mathematics could be demonstrated within mathematics.
Several revolutionary theories, including activity and quantum theory, challenged existing assumptions in physics in the early 20th century. The work of a number of mathematicians contributed to these theories. Among them was Noether, whose gender had denied her a paid position at the University of Gottingen. Noether’s mathematical formulations on invariants (quantities that remain unchanged as other quantities change) contributed to Einstein’s   theory of relativity. Russian mathematician Hermann Minkowski contributed to the relativity the notion of the space time continuum, with time as a fourth dimension. Herman Weyl, a student of Hilbert’s, investigated the geometry of relativity and applied group theory to quantum mechanics. Weyl’s investigation helped advance the field of topology. Early in the century Hilbert quipped, “Physics is getting too dificult for physicists.”       
On the other hand, mathematicians, physicists, and engineers contributed to the development of computers and computer science. But the early, theoretical work came from mathematicians. English mathematician Alan Turing, working at Cambridge University, introduced the idea of a machine that could perform mathematical operations and solve equations. The Turing machine, as it became known, was a precursor of the modern computer. Through his work Turing brought together the elements that form the basis of computer science: symbolic logic, numerical analysis, electrical engineering, and a mechanical vision of human thought processes.

Albert Einstein was born in Ulm, Wurttemberg Kingdom, Germany on March 14th, 1879. His father named Hermann Einstein and his mother was Pauline. His parents were married in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt.
Einstein family is the family of Jewish descent. His father worked as a merchant feather bed then switch work to become an expert on electrochemistry.
Until now, Albert Einstein is known as the greatest and the most famous theoretical physics in the 20th century. He put forward the theory of relativity and give a huge contributed to the development of statistical mechanics, cosmology, and quantum mechanics.
As a child, Albert Einstein had a quiet nature and does not like to play with his friends. He was considered a slow learner, probably caused by shyness, dyslexia, or because of the structure of rare and unusual in his brain (examined after his death).
In addition, to cultivate the science and also in school, Einstein’s activities are just playing music together with her mother. He really likes to play the masterpiece of Beethoven and Mozart. His family is concern about their child’s education in the field of science and music.
Although considered to be slow in learning, but it didn’t demoralize him to learn. Even, in the end, he had been granted the Nobel Prize in physics over his devotion to the physics theoretical where to develop his general theory of relativity in 1921.
One of the most famous formula and make it widely known is that the theory of relativity formula E=mc ².
In 1984, when Einstein was 15 years old, his family’s economic situation deteriorated. His father’s business went bankrupt in electronics. This makes Einstein and his family moved to Pavia, Milan-Italy.
Einstein stayed to finish school, and completed one semester before rejoining his family in Pavia.
Albert Einstein had several times tried to sign up for the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, in Zurich named Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule. But he always failed the test.
In the following year, he was sent by his family to Aarau, Switzerland, to quickly finish high school, where he received a diploma in 1896.
In 1896, when Einstein was 17 years old, he decided to remove citizenship and prefer to not have citizens disillusioned with the German government. At the time of the German government is very anti to the Jews.
It also supported that after the departure of Einstein from Germany, eventually controlled by Nazi Germany which is known to be very anti-Jewish.
During the period of 1901, Einstein discussed his interest in the world of science to his close friends, including Mileva. Then he falls in love with Mileva Einstein, and they were both in a relationship.
Right up in January 1902, Einstein and Mileva blessed with a daughter named Lieserl. However, Lieserl Einstein at the time was considered illegal because her parents are not married.
In the end, Einstein and Mileva were married on January 6th, 1903. From this marriage, they were given another child named Hans Albert Einstein. Hans was born on May 14th, 1904.
On April 17th, 1955, Albert Einstein experienced internal bleeding. Surgery performed by Dr. Rudolph Nissen in 1948 suffered damage, where the rupture of Einstein’s abdominal aortic aneurysm.
When medical action’d be taken, Einstein refused to do surgery. He said lowliness:
“I want to go when I want. It is tasteless to prolong life artificially. I have done my share; it is time to go. I will do it elegantly.”
He died at Princeton Hospital, in the morning, at the time he was 76 years old. During the autopsy, Thomas Stoltz Harvey, the pathologist of Princeton Hospital, delete Einstein’s brain for preservation without the permission of his family.
This is the hope that in the future neuroscience will be able to discover what made Einstein so intelligent. Einstein’s remains were cremated and his ashes scattered in a location that is still kept secret.

                                            Albert Einstein - Physics Scientist, Originator of the Theory of RelativityRead the text below!Albert Einstein was born in Ulm, Germany, on March 14, 1879. He grew up in Germany, Italy, and Switzerland. Einstein taught himself geometry when he was 12 years old. School bored him because it required endless memorizing and reciting. He often skipped classes to study on his own or to play his violin. Yet he graduated from college in 1900 and earned a Ph.D. degree in 1905. From 1902 to 1907, Einstein worked as a clerk in the patent office in Zürich, Switzerland. His job left him plenty of time to think.Einstein thought about the rules that govern the way the world works. For example, he explained why small particles in liquids wiggle around, a movement called Brownian motion. He said that the particles were being bumped into by tiny bits of matter called atoms that are too small to see.He also thought about light and electricity. Einstein knew that light shining on metal sometimes causes electricity to flow. He explained this result, called the photoelectric effect, by saying that light is made of tiny bundles of energy called photons. Photons hitting the metal knock particles called electrons away. Since electricity is simply moving electrons, he had solved the mystery of the photoelectric effect. In 1921, Einstein won the most famous prize in science, the Nobel Prize, for this work.Another thing Einstein thought about was time. He said that time does not always flow at the same rate. He proposed that motion affects time. He called this idea the special theory of relativity.Einstein then came up with his general theory of relativity. This theory has a new explanation for gravity. Einstein said that gravity comes from curves or dents in the fabric of space. Objects make dents in space the way a bowling ball makes a dent in a mattress. The Moon falls into the dent made by Earth and rolls around the Earth. Scientists later proved that the dent a star makes in space-time bends light as the light passes by.Einstein changed physics by showing that new ideas could come just from thinking. Before Einstein, most new ideas in physics had come from experiments in the laboratory.1. What kind of the text above? * *a. Personal recountb. Factual recountc. Imaginative recountd.

                                            Since 1929, physicists have known that the universe is expanding. Most physicists hold that the entire observable universe was condensed into a tiny area of exceptional density and that this initial mass exploded outward in what is commonly referred to as the "Big Bang." The universe has been expanding steadily ever since this cataclysmic event and most physicists naturally assumed that this expansion must be gradually slowing down. Some theorists even predicted that the gravitational pull of the universe would cause the eventual contraction of the universe—the "Big Crunch." However, in 1998, a team of observers studying supernovae made a shocking discovery. Instead of slowing down, the expansion of the universe is accelerating. In fact, the acceleration appeared to have begun some 10 billion years ago. Later measurements of the cosmic microwave background and a survey of the distribution of galaxies seem to corroborate the initial finding that the expansion of the universe Is indeed accelerating. Cosmologists believe the most likely explanation for the acceleration of the universe's expansion is an entity known as dark energy According to theory, dark energy should account for approximately two-thirds of the total cosmic energy density. It also Is believed to be gravitationally repulsive and diffused throughout the areas of space unoccupied by galaxies. Although theoretically possible, dark energy, if it were found to exist, would provide theorists with a number of difficulties and perhaps even require an extensive rethinking of fundamental physics. Some cosmologists believe that the existence of dark energy implies the existence of subatomic particles more than thirty orders of magnitude smaller than the electron. Others have tinkered with Einstein's theory of relativity in an attempt to account for the perceived effects of dark energy. Such drastic revisions to long-held tenets have encouraged some physicists to seek a more conventional solution to the accelerating universe enigma, one that does not invoke the specter of dark energy. These theories posit more mundane explanations. such as the aggregate gravitational effect of interstellar dust. Recently, four independent groups have found evidence of the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, a phenomenon linked to the presence of dark energy. 1) 1. The passage is primarily concerned with ....

                            4. Albert EinsteinAlbert Einstein was one of the most famous scientists of all time. He developed the special and general theories of relativity and made many other important discoveries.Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany. He grew up in a secular Jewish family. His father was a salesman and engineer and his mother was a housewife. Einstein had one sister, Maja, who was born two years after him. He studied at the Luitpold Gymnasium in Munich. He didnt like studying there. One teacher even told him that he would never get anywhere. At this time, Einstein became interested in classical music and he learned to play the violin. He was also interested in science.In the 1890s, Einsteins family moved to Milan, Italy. Einstein started studying at the Swiss Federal Polytechnic School in Zürich. His years in Zürich were some of the happiest years of his life. He became friends with many other students and met his future wife, Mileva Maric, a physics student from Serbia.Einstein finished his university studies and found work in a Swiss patent office. In his free time, Einstein continued studying physics. He married Mileva Maric in 1903, but the marriage was not a happy one. They divorced in 1919 and Einstein married Elsa Löwenthal. In 1905, Einstein published four important papers about physics. The fourth paper included the famous equation E=mc2. In 1921, he won the Nobel Prize for Physics. From 1913 to 1933, Albert Einstein was the director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin. He often travelled around the world and gave talks about physics. While Einstein was travelling and speaking internationally, the Nazis were becoming more and more powerful. Einsteins life was in danger. In 1932, he decided to leave Germany forever. He moved to the United States and took on a position at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, New Jersey.Einstein became an American citizen in 1935. In 1939, he and his friend Leo Szilard wrote a letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. They warned him that the Nazis might be trying to create an atomic bomb. The United States started a programme to create its own nuclear weapons. After learning of the 1945 bombing of Hiroshima, Einstein became active in trying to stop future use of nuclear weapons. He also supported the civil rights of African Americans. In 1952, he was offered to become the president of Israel, but he respectfully declined.Albert Einstein died on April 18, 1955, in Princeton, New Jersey.1 Read the text and answer the following questions.1 What was Albert Einsteins fathers job? _____________________________________________________________2 What did Albert Einstein do after he finished his university studies? _______________________________________3 When did Albert Einstein get the Nobel Prize for Physics? _______________________________________________4 Why did Einstein decide to leave Germany? __________________________________________________________5 When did Einstein become an American citizen? ______________________________________________________6 Why did Einstein write a letter to F.

                            9. I.Read the following text carefully. 
In some ways pure mathematics became more abstract in the 20th century, as it joined forces with the field of symbolic logic in philosophy. The scholars who bridged the fields of mathematics and philosophy early in the century were Alfred North Whitehead and Betrand Russell, who worked together at Cambridge University. They published their major work, Principia Mathematica in three volumes from 1910 to 1913. In it they demonstrated the principle of methematical logic and attempted to show that all of mathematics could be deduced from a few premises and definitions by the rules of formal logic. In the late 19th century, German mathematician Gottlob Frege had provided the system of notation for mathematical logic and paved the way for the work of Russel and Whitehead. Mathematical logic influenced the direction of 20th century mathematics, including the work of Hilbert proposing that the underlying consistency of all mathematics could be demonstrated within mathematics.
Several revolutionary theories, including activity and quantum theory, challenged existing assumptions in physics in the early 20th century. The work of a number of mathematicians contributed to these theories. Among them was Noether, whose gender had denied her a paid position at the University of Gottingen. Noether’s mathematical formulations on invariants (quantities that remain unchanged as other quantities change) contributed to Einstein’s   theory of relativity. Russian mathematician Hermann Minkowski contributed to the relativity the notion of the space time continuum, with time as a fourth dimension. Herman Weyl, a student of Hilbert’s, investigated the geometry of relativity and applied group theory to quantum mechanics. Weyl’s investigation helped advance the field of topology. Early in the century Hilbert quipped, “Physics is getting too dificult for physicists.”       
On the other hand, mathematicians, physicists, and engineers contributed to the development of computers and computer science. But the early, theoretical work came from mathematicians. English mathematician Alan Turing, working at Cambridge University, introduced the idea of a machine that could perform mathematical operations and solve equations. The Turing machine, as it became known, was a precursor of the modern computer. Through his work Turing brought together the elements that form the basis of computer science: symbolic logic, numerical analysis, electrical engineering, and a mechanical vision of human thought processes.

                            15. Albert EinsteinAlbert Einstein is one of the most notable and influential scientists of the twentiethcentury. Although he became known as a genius of science and gained considerablefame later in life, as a child he was slow in learning to speak, and had a rebelliousnature towards the conventional styles of learning at school, which left many teachersto believe he would arount to little.Inspired by a compass, his "sacred little geometry book, and classical music hisinterest in science and mathematics grew and by the age of sixteen he was writing hisfirst research science paper, and attempting to skip the last few years of high school toenter the Swiss Institute of Technology. He failed the entrance exam but set a precedentin his life for thinking outside of the box and challenging the rules.His most famous discovery is the theory of relativity, E-MC, which overturnedIsaac Newton's laws by explaining the relation of energy and mass as a consequenceofspaceand time. First introduced in a 3-page paper in 1905, the theory was sorevolutionary it couldn't be proven until more advanced technology was availableyears laterAlbert Einstein is not only a world-renowned scientist who left an indelible markon the world but also an icon of popular culture whose name and image have cometo represent genius and intellect.Adapted from: http://www.biography.comWho was Albert Einstein?A.

                            18. Albert Einstein
 Albert Einstein is one of the most notable and influential scientists of the twentieth 
century. Although he became known as a genius of science and gained considerable 
fame later in life, as a child he was slow in learning to speak, and had a rebellious 
nature towards the conventional styles of learning at school, which left many teachers 
to believe he would amount to little.
 Inspired by a compass, his “sacred little geometry book”, and classical music, his 
interest in science and mathematics grew and by the age of sixteen he was writing his 
first research science paper, and attempting to skip the last few years of high school to 
enter the Swiss Institute of Technology. He failed the entrance exam but set a
precedent in his life for thinking outside of the box and challenging the rules.
 His most famous discovery is the theory of relativity, E=MC2
, which overturned 
Isaac Newton’s laws by explaining the relation of energy and mass as a consequence 
of space and time. First introduced in a 3-page paper in 1905, the theory was so 
revolutionary it couldn’t be proven until more advanced technology was available 
years later.
 Albert Einstein is not only a world-renowned scientist who left an indelible mark 
on the world but also an icon of popular culture whose name and image have come to 
represent genius and intellect.

Albert Einstein was born in Ulm, Wurttemberg Kingdom, Germany on March 14th, 1879. His father named Hermann Einstein and his mother was Pauline. His parents were married in Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt.
Einstein family is the family of Jewish descent. His father worked as a merchant feather bed then switch work to become an expert on electrochemistry.
Until now, Albert Einstein is known as the greatest and the most famous theoretical physics in the 20th century. He put forward the theory of relativity and give a huge contributed to the development of statistical mechanics, cosmology, and quantum mechanics.
As a child, Albert Einstein had a quiet nature and does not like to play with his friends. He was considered a slow learner, probably caused by shyness, dyslexia, or because of the structure of rare and unusual in his brain (examined after his death).
In addition, to cultivate the science and also in school, Einstein’s activities are just playing music together with her mother. He really likes to play the masterpiece of Beethoven and Mozart. His family is concern about their child’s education in the field of science and music.
Although considered to be slow in learning, but it didn’t demoralize him to learn. Even, in the end, he had been granted the Nobel Prize in physics over his devotion to the physics theoretical where to develop his general theory of relativity in 1921.
One of the most famous formula and make it widely known is that the theory of relativity formula E=mc ².
In 1984, when Einstein was 15 years old, his family’s economic situation deteriorated. His father’s business went bankrupt in electronics. This makes Einstein and his family moved to Pavia, Milan-Italy.
Einstein stayed to finish school, and completed one semester before rejoining his family in Pavia.
Albert Einstein had several times tried to sign up for the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, in Zurich named Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule. But he always failed the test.
In the following year, he was sent by his family to Aarau, Switzerland, to quickly finish high school, where he received a diploma in 1896.
In 1896, when Einstein was 17 years old, he decided to remove citizenship and prefer to not have citizens disillusioned with the German government. At the time of the German government is very anti to the Jews.
It also supported that after the departure of Einstein from Germany, eventually controlled by Nazi Germany which is known to be very anti-Jewish.
During the period of 1901, Einstein discussed his interest in the world of science to his close friends, including Mileva. Then he falls in love with Mileva Einstein, and they were both in a relationship.
Right up in January 1902, Einstein and Mileva blessed with a daughter named Lieserl. However, Lieserl Einstein at the time was considered illegal because her parents are not married.
In the end, Einstein and Mileva were married on January 6th, 1903. From this marriage, they were given another child named Hans Albert Einstein. Hans was born on May 14th, 1904.
On April 17th, 1955, Albert Einstein experienced internal bleeding. Surgery performed by Dr. Rudolph Nissen in 1948 suffered damage, where the rupture of Einstein’s abdominal aortic aneurysm.
When medical action’d be taken, Einstein refused to do surgery. He said lowliness:
“I want to go when I want. It is tasteless to prolong life artificially. I have done my share; it is time to go. I will do it elegantly.”
He died at Princeton Hospital, in the morning, at the time he was 76 years old. During the autopsy, Thomas Stoltz Harvey, the pathologist of Princeton Hospital, delete Einstein’s brain for preservation without the permission of his family.
This is the hope that in the future neuroscience will be able to discover what made Einstein so intelligent. Einstein’s remains were cremated and his ashes scattered in a location that is still kept secret.

                            28. Einstein developed the theory of relativity one of the pillars of modern physics​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>Albert Einstein (/ˈaɪnstaɪn/ eyen-styne;[4] bahasa Jerman: [ˈalbɛɐ̯t ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn] ( simak); 14 Maret 1879 – 18 April 1955) adalah fisikawan teoretis kelahiran Jerman[5] yang mengembangkan teori relativitas, satu dari dua pilar utama fisika modern (bersama mekanika kuantum).[3][6]:274 Karya-karyanya juga dikenal karena berpengaruh terhadap filsafat ilmu.[7][8] Persamaan Einstein yang paling dikenal adalah rumus kesetaraan massa-energi {\displaystyle E=mc^{2}}{\displaystyle E=mc^{2}}, yang dijuluki "persamaan paling terkenal di dunia".[9] Einstein menerima Nobel Fisika pada tahun 1921 "atas jasanya terhadap fisika teoretis, dan khususnya atas penemuannya tentang hukum efek fotolistrik",[10] yang menjadi langkah penting dalam pengembangan teori kuantum.
</p><p>
</p><p>Menjelang awal kariernya, Einstein berpendapat bahwa mekanika Newton tak lagi mampu menyatukan hukum mekanika klasik dengan hukum medan elektromagnetik. Hal ini mendorongnya mengembangkan teori relativitas khusus saat bekerja di Kantor Paten Swiss di Bern (1902–1909). Tetapi, ia kemudian menyadari bahwa prinsip relativitas juga dapat diperluas cakupannya pada medan gravitasi, dan ia menerbitkan sebuah makalah mengenai relativitas umum pada tahun 1916 dengan teorinya tentang gravitasi. Einstein terus meneliti masalah mekanika statistika dan teori kuantum, yang mengarah pada penjelasannya mengenai teori partikel dan gerak molekul. Einstein juga meneliti kandungan termal cahaya yang meletakkan dasar bagi teori foton cahaya. Pada tahun 1917, ia menerapkan teori relativitas umum untuk memodelkan struktur alam semesta.[11][12]
</p><p>
</p><p>Setelah menghabiskan waktu satu tahun di Praha, Einstein tinggal di Swiss antara tahun 1895 dan 1914, melepas kewarganegaraan Jermannya pada tahun 1896, dan lulus sarjana dari sekolah politeknik federal Swiss (kelak Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, ETH) di Zürich pada tahun 1900. Setelah hidup tanpa kewarganegaraan selama lebih dari lima tahun, Einstein memperoleh kewarganegaraan Swiss pada tahun 1901, yang tetap ia pegang sampai akhir hayatnya. Pada tahun 1905, ia dianugerahi gelar PhD oleh Universitas Zurich. Pada tahun yang sama, Einstein menerbitkan empat makalah terobosan pada masa annus mirabilis (tahun mukjizat), yang menghantarkannya memasuki dunia akademis pada usia 26 tahun. Einstein mengajar fisika teoretis di Zurich dari tahun 1912 sampai 1914, kemudian pindah ke Berlin dan menjadi anggota Akademi Sains Prusia.
</p><p>
</p><p>Pada tahun 1933, ketika Einstein mengunjungi Amerika Serikat, Adolf Hitler berkuasa. Karena latar belakang Yahudinya, Einstein memilih tidak kembali ke Jerman.[13] Ia menetap di Amerika Serikat dan menjadi warga negara Amerika pada tahun 1940.[14] Menjelang Perang Dunia II, Einstein mengirim surat kepada Presiden Franklin D. Roosevelt, yang memperingatkannya mengenai potensi pengembangan "bom jenis baru yang sangat dahsyat" dan menyarankan agar AS segera memulai penelitian serupa. Sarannya ini pada akhirnya mengarah pada Proyek Manhattan. Einstein mendukung Sekutu, tetapi menentang gagasan penggunaan fisi nuklir sebagai senjata. Einstein menandatangani Manifesto Russell–Einstein bersama filsuf Britania Raya Bertrand Russell, yang menyoroti dan mengecam bahaya senjata nuklir. Ia mengabdi di Institute for Advanced Study di Princeton, New Jersey, hingga kematiannya pada tahun 1955.
</p><p>
</p><p>Einstein menerbitkan lebih dari 300 makalah ilmiah dan lebih dari 150 karya nonilmiah.[11][15] Prestasi intelektual dan orisinalitasnya menjadikan kata "Einstein" identik dengan "genius".[16] Menurut Eugene Wigner, "pemahaman Einstein lebih dalam dari Jancsi von Neumann. Pikirannya lebih tajam dan lebih orisinal daripada von Neumann. Dan itu adalah pemikiran yang sangat luar biasa."[17]</p><p><strong>Penjelasan:</strong></p><p>maaf kalau salah</p><br />

He often skipped classes to study on his own or to play his violin. Yet he graduated from college in 1900 and earned a Ph.D. degree in 1905. From 1902 to 1907, Einstein worked as a clerk in the patent office in Zürich, Switzerland. His job left him plenty of time to think.Einstein thought about the rules that govern the way the world works. For example, he explained why small particles in liquids wiggle around, a movement called Brownian motion. He said that the particles were being bumped into by tiny bits of matter called atoms that are too small to see.He also thought about light and electricity. Einstein knew that light shining on metal sometimes causes electricity to flow. He explained this result, called the photoelectric effect, by saying that light is made of tiny bundles of energy called photons. Photons hitting the metal knock particles called electrons away. Since electricity is simply moving electrons, he had solved the mystery of the photoelectric effect. In 1921, Einstein won the most famous prize in science, the Nobel Prize, for this work.Another thing Einstein thought about was time. He said that time does not always flow at the same rate. He proposed that motion affects time. He called this idea the special theory of relativity.Einstein then came up with his general theory of relativity. This theory has a new explanation for gravity. Einstein said that gravity comes from curves or dents in the fabric of space. Objects make dents in space the way a bowling ball makes a dent in a mattress. The Moon falls into the dent made by Earth and rolls around the Earth. Scientists later proved that the dent a star makes in space-time bends light as the light passes by.Einstein changed physics by showing that new ideas could come just from thinking. Before Einstein, most new ideas in physics had come from experiments in the laboratory.1. What kind of the text above? * *a. Personal recountb. Factual recountc. Imaginative recountd.

                            33. Since 1929, physicists have known that the universe is expanding. Most physicists hold that the entire observable universe was condensed into a tiny area of exceptional density and that this initial mass exploded outward in what is commonly referred to as the "Big Bang." The universe has been expanding steadily ever since this cataclysmic event and most physicists naturally assumed that this expansion must be gradually slowing down. Some theorists even predicted that the gravitational pull of the universe would cause the eventual contraction of the universe—the "Big Crunch." However, in 1998, a team of observers studying supernovae made a shocking discovery. Instead of slowing down, the expansion of the universe is accelerating. In fact, the acceleration appeared to have begun some 10 billion years ago. Later measurements of the cosmic microwave background and a survey of the distribution of galaxies seem to corroborate the initial finding that the expansion of the universe Is indeed accelerating. Cosmologists believe the most likely explanation for the acceleration of the universe's expansion is an entity known as dark energy According to theory, dark energy should account for approximately two-thirds of the total cosmic energy density. It also Is believed to be gravitationally repulsive and diffused throughout the areas of space unoccupied by galaxies. Although theoretically possible, dark energy, if it were found to exist, would provide theorists with a number of difficulties and perhaps even require an extensive rethinking of fundamental physics. Some cosmologists believe that the existence of dark energy implies the existence of subatomic particles more than thirty orders of magnitude smaller than the electron. Others have tinkered with Einstein's theory of relativity in an attempt to account for the perceived effects of dark energy. Such drastic revisions to long-held tenets have encouraged some physicists to seek a more conventional solution to the accelerating universe enigma, one that does not invoke the specter of dark energy. These theories posit more mundane explanations. such as the aggregate gravitational effect of interstellar dust. Recently, four independent groups have found evidence of the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, a phenomenon linked to the presence of dark energy. 1) 1. The passage is primarily concerned with ....
